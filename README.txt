I know this project is very straight forward but I figured I should at least showcase the extent of my UI coding skills.
I could have used React Router and just passed the required data. 
Or created 2 components with parent child relationship with a callback parameter in the child.
So I decided to use react with typescript. 
Redux for state management
Redux Observables to manage the API calls.


How to setup:

1. Assuming that Node.js is installed, open any command line tool(cmd or powershell). 
2. Navigate to the the project folder(the one with package.json)
3. execute "npm install" and wait for it to finish. when it says "happy hacking", we are good to go. 
4. execute "npm start" to start the service. The app will open in a new browser tab.
