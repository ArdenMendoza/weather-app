I know this project is very straight forward but I figured I should at least showcase the extent of my UI coding skills.
I could have used React Router and just passed the required data. 
Or created 2 components with parent child relationship with a callback parameter in the child.
So I decided to use react with typescript. 
Redux for state management
Redux Observables to manage the API calls.
